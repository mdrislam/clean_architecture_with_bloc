## Features

- 🔍 Search GitHub repositories by name
- ⭐ Sort repositories by stars in descending order
- 📱 Pagination with infinite scroll
- 📦 Offline caching support
- 🌓 Dark/light mode toggle
- 🔍 Repository details view
- 🚦 Error handling with retry
- 🔄 Pull-to-refresh functionality
- 💫 Shimmer loading effects

## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture with three main layers:
lib/
├── core/ # Framework-agnostic core (constants, errors, utils)
├── data/ # Data sources and repositories
├── domain/ # Business logic and entities
└── presentation/ # UI and presentation logic

### Key Components
- **BLoC**: State management using flutter_bloc
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data layer implementation
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied throughout the codebase
- **Dependency Injection**: Manual dependency management

Technical Implementation
Key Packages
Package	Purpose
flutter_bloc	State management
http	API requests
shared_preferences	Local caching
url_launcher	Opening URLs
shimmer	Loading animations
API Integration
Uses GitHub's search API:

text
GET /search/repositories?q={query}+in:name&sort=stars&order=desc&page={page}&per_page=20
Offline Support
Caches API responses using SharedPreferences

Shows cached data when offline

Visual indicator for cached data in the UI

Pagination
Implements infinite scroll

Loads 20 items per page

Automatic loading when scrolling to bottom

Assumptions & Limitations
Assumptions
Default search query is "flutter"

Only first page is cached for offline use

GitHub API rate limits (60 requests/hour) are sufficient for demo

No authentication required for basic search functionality

Limitations
Caching only applies to first page results

Pagination limited to 1000 results by GitHub API

No user authentication for higher rate limits

Simple caching strategy without expiration

Testing
Unit Tests
Run all unit tests:

bash
flutter test
Test coverage includes:

BLoC state transitions

Repository logic

Data source implementations

Use case validation

Widget Tests
Key widget tests:

Home screen states (loading, success, error)

List item rendering

Detail screen display

Theme switching functionality

Bonus Features Implemented
✅ Pull-to-refresh

✅ Unit tests for BLoC and repositories

✅ Shimmer loading effects

✅ Dynamic theme switching

✅ Modular folder structure

✅ Custom page transitions

Demo Video
Watch App Demo Replace with actual video link

Future Improvements
Implement proper cache expiration policy

Add user authentication for higher API limits

Include repository bookmarking feature

Add more sorting options (forks, updated date)

Implement localization for multiple languages

Add integration tests
